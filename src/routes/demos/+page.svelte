<h1>Extension documentation</h1>

<p class="notdoc">You might be wondering "damn this extension is probably pretty cool but idk what any of these blocks do". If you are, you're in luck because I planned for this and documented stuff.</p>
<p class="notdoc">Note: some of the block colors are a little off, it's a scratchblocks skill issue</p>

<h3>Here are the currently documented extensions:</h3>
